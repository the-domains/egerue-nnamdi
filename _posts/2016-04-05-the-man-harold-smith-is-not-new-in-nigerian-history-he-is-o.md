* The man Harold Smith is not new in Nigerian history. He is one
of the architects of colonial foundation that midwife Nigerian independence in
1960.I met him in a meeting three weeks ago where he opened up a bit about the
lingering problem in Africa especially; Nigeria unbalanced protracted social
political situations. We asked if he could make this

known to
the media. His response was "I am in my 80s now; I have agreed but in the past
'they' did not want me to say anything, but now I don't want to go to my grave
without telling the truth about the atrocities perpetrated in Africa by the
colonialists. Brothers and sisters; on Ben TV last Thursday, Harold Smith was
on a program to reveal what went behind the scene before the independence. The
Oxford University graduate had this to say about his role in Nigeria pre and
after independence era.

Our agenda was to completely exploit Africa. Nigeria was my duty
post. When we assessed Nigeria, this was what we found in the southern region;
strength, intelligence, determination to succeed, well established history,
complex but focused life style, great hope and aspirations... the East is good in
business and technology, the west is good in administration and commerce, law
and medicine, but it was a pity we planned our agenda to give power "at all
cost" to the northerner. They seemed to be submissive and silly of a kind. Our
mission was accomplished by destroying the opposition at all fronts. The west
led in the fight for the independence, and was punished for asking for freedom.
They will not rule Nigeria!

Harold Smith confessed that the Census results were announced
before they were counted. Despite seeing vast land with no human but cattle in
the north, we still gave the north 55 million instead of 32 Million. This was
to be used to maintain their majority votes and future power bid. He stated
that the West without Lagos was the most populous in Nigeria at that time but
we ignored that. The north was seriously encouraged to go into the military.

According to him, they believe that the south may attend western
education, but future leaders will always come from military background. Their
traditional rulers were to be made influential and super human. The northerners
were given accelerated promotions both in the military and civil service to
justify their superiority over the south. Everything was to work against the
south. We truncated their good plan for their future. "I was very sorry for the
A.G; it was a great party too much for African standard. We planned to destroy
Awolowo and Azikwe well, the west and the east and sowed a seed of discord
among them". We tricked Azikwe into accepting to be president having known that
Balewa will be the main man with power. Awolowo has to go to jail to cripple
his genius plans for a greater Nigeria.

However, Harold Smith justified the British agenda of
colonialism in Nigeria, which he believed was originally to help build Africa
after the ruins of slave trade, but lamented that the British only looked after
themselves and not after Nigerian interest. The British really let Nigeria
down. When I see Nigerian been accused of fraud and from what I saw on the
streets of Lagos; the British were worst fraudsters.

Looking at the northern leaders now he said, "If they have any
agenda in Nigeria at all, sadly it is only for the north, and nothing for
Nigeria. He stated that the British look after the British people and this is
so all over the world. He said the time has come now to see people of
intelligent minds with an open and inclusive agenda for all Nigerians in
power...people who will really look after Nigerians large population...but "I still
curiously and sorrowfully see now that the British has not let go of
Nigeria...her wealth,. her potentials, her future.

He opined that the Caucasian people now assert themselves as the
keeper of the "New Age" keys. He therefore said that it is only logical for
Europeans to maintain their position of power, scientific superiority, economic
exploitation, they must continue to perpetuate their lies and falsehoods and
this is the most unkindest cut of all in relation to Nigeria situation!

According to him, Nigeria, a great nation was crippled not
because of military juntas or corrupt leaders alone but by the British and
American fear of Nigeria great future. He confessed, "The fear of the place
that will be our 'dumping ground' really occupied our minds".

Some of the things he said were not new to Nigerians or to the
whole world but hearing it from the horse's mouth is quite revealing and
established more reality zones. He finally submitted that the colonial masters
have caused havoc while they were in Africa, and planted timed bombs when they
finally left. What we see since independence, the administration of new
internal colonial masters by fellow Nigerians holding sway in power is doing
more damage to Nigeria. Instead of detonating the time bombs planted by the
British, the north is planting mines.

He added that 'It was my duty to carry out all of the above and
I was loyal to my country. Nigerians should try to be loyal to their country
leaders and followers alike. Love your country. You have got the potentials to
be great again and the whole world knows this'.

I am sorry for the above evil done to Nigeria. I can't say sorry
enough......"
