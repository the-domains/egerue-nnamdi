  Abuja – The United Kingdom has announced a further £32 million over the next
  three years to help deliver basic, life-saving assistance and protection to
  some of the estimated 7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance due
  to the conflict in north east Nigeria. The funds will be channelled through
  the United Nations (UN), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
  and other humanitarian organisations, and will be used to provide support for
  critical life-saving areas including nutrition, food security, water and
  sanitation, and protection of civilians affected by the conflict. Apart from
  the cash, the United Kingdom will also provide the needed technical expertise
  to Nigeria to drive the programmes and ensure maximum benefit for its people.
  This was announced in Abuja by the UK Minister for International Development,
  Nick Hurd, who is in Nigeria for official engagements. Hurd said: “The UK is
  committed to continuing to help Nigeria to provide humanitarian assistance and
  protection for people affected by the conflict in north east Nigeria. We
  welcome Nigeria’s efforts to support the affected population. We look forward
  to continuing to work with all partners to strengthen the humanitarian effort
  to reach the most vulnerable, many of whom are in areas that are difficult to
  access.” Mr. Hurd also noted that the humanitarian needs in north east Nigeria
  are enormous and growing. A sustained, large-scale Government-led response is
  needed to meet people’s basic needs and to help them to rebuild their lives
  once security conditions allow them to return to their places of origin. This
  new funding is in addition to more than £8.2 million provided by the UK since
  2014 to help respond to the life-saving humanitarian needs of people affected
  by the conflict though violence, displacement, and loss of livelihoods. In
  addition, the Minister announced a substantial increase of £16.7 million
  pounds the UK is giving to Nigeria’s rapidly growing solar energy market. The
  additional funding is in support of a UK sponsored Solar Nigeria Programme
  that was approved in September 2013 with a budget of £37.1 million pounds. The
  programme has already supported access to household energy for more than
  130,000 people since it was launched in 2014. It has also supported improved
  healthcare and education for about 185,000 people in Lagos, and earlier this
  week it won the award for “Outstanding international development project –
  infrastructure” at the 2016 British Expertise International Awards. The UK’s
  overall £222 million / year programme in Nigeria improves health and education
  systems, addresses malnutrition, improves governance, removes the constraints
  to growth and helps Nigeria better target its own resources. Over 60% of DFID
  Nigeria’s programme is targeted at northern Nigeria where the needs are
  greatest.
