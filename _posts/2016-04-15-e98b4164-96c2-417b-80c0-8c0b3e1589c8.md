  Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has hailed the international community,
  especially the United States of America and the United Kingdom for joining
  lovers of democracy in Nigeria to speak out against the All Progressives
  Congress (APC) government of President Muhammadu Buhari’s use of State
  security apparatus to oppress opposition. He called on the British Government
  to investigate the allegation of the use of British foreign aid given to
  Nigeria to help combat Boko Haram terrorists to fund a witch-hunt against
  opposition politicians with a view to preventing continuous use of fund
  belonging to the country wrongly. Ayodele Fayose Speaking through Lere
  Olayinka, his Special Assistant on Public Communications and New Media,
  Governor Fayose said the international community must focus attention on
  Nigeria under President Buhari, saying; “rights of Nigerians are now being
  trampled upon with impunity.” In its report, the United States Department of
  States, accused the Nigerian police, DSS and the military of gross abuse of
  power which include citizens brutality, arbitrary detention,bribery among
  other scandals Also, the United Kingdom based Telegraph newspaper published
  this week that hundreds of millions of pounds of British foreign aid given to
  Nigeria to help combat Boko Haram terrorists was instead being used to fund a
  witch-hunt against opposition politicians. Governor Fayose, who is presently
  in Guangzhou, China to attend the 119th China Import and Export Fair otherwise
  known as the Canton Fair between April 14 and 19, said the United Kingdom
  Telegraph newspaper was right in its report that the Buhari’s government was
  using British aid money to target his political opponents, particularly
  through anti corruption agencies ans the Department of State Services (DSS).
  He said only the international community could help prevail on President
  Buhari to respect the rule of law and stop ruling Nigeria like a military
  dictator. The governor described the United States Department of States report
  as another vindication of his position on the Buhari-led government’s abuse of
  the rights of Nigerians, saying; “everything I predicted about Buhari is
  coming to pass and the international community must assist the country to
  sustain democracy.”
