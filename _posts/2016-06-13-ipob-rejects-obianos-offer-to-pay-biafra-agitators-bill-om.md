  IPOB rejects Obiano's offer to pay Biafra agitator's bill Omotayo Yusuf 3 days
  ago 58999 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Send email – IPOB has accused
  Governor Obiano of trying to get cheap popularity – The separatist group said
  it does not want the governor’s offer – An APC chieftain in Enugu also blamed
  the governor The Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) has rejected the offer of
  Governor Wille Obiano of Anambra state to pay the hospital bills of Biafra
  agitators injured during their 49 years anniversary. Vanguard reports that the
  governor made the pledge at Nkpor town hall when he came to sympathize with
  the people of Nkpor. READ ALSO: MASSOB issues warning to Governor Obiano
  During the celebration of the declaration of Biafra on Monday, June 30, there
  was a clash between pro-Biafra agitators and the army which led to the death
  of some members of the separatist group while several others were injured.
  IPOB through its media and publicity officer Mr Emma Powerful dismissed the
  governor’s offer to offset the hospital bills of the wounded Biafra and non
  Biafra agitators and described the gesture as medicine after death and an
  attempt to win cheap popularity. “The governor was insulting the families of
  the dead Biafrans and those that their own are still nursing gunshot wounds in
  different hospitals and for the purpose of clarity, no gunshot wound victim is
  still in Anambra State, they have all been taken out of Anambra because the
  soldiers were combing all the hospitals in the state for them.” READ ALSO:
  MASSOB, BIM appeal to UN to divide Nigeria Chief Zeribe Ezeanuna who is a
  chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in the state faulted the governor
  for the clash. He demanded an apology from him and claimed that if he had not
  sanctioned the military engagement, it would not have been carried out.
  Meanwhile, IPOB has labelled Igbo elders who visited President Muhammadu
  Buhari as traitors. The elders visited the president in the wake of the clash
  that occurred between protesters and Biafra agitators. In a press statement
  signed by its coordinator, Clifford Iroanya, the group said it was surprised
  at the likes of those who rushed to Buhari and congratulated him for
  reportedly killing Biafrans on the fateful day and not to condemn his
  murderous act or to discuss the process of restoration of Biafra.
