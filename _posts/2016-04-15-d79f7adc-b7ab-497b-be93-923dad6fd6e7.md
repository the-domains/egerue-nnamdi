  A movement, New Igbo Vision in APC Lagos has called on Igbo people in Lagos
  State to re-establish the harmonious relationship that existed between them
  and their hosts in Lagos. The group regretted the acrimony which created the
  impression that Ndigbo were at loggerheads with their hosts and other ethnic
  nationalities in Lagos. Addressing a joint press conference in Lagos, the APC
  Publicity Secretary in Lagos and Eze Ndigbo in Lagos, Messrs Joe Igbokwe and
  Eze Uche Dimgba respectively, appealed to Igbos in Lagos “who are passionate
  towards promoting progressive politics and the interest of Ndgbo to key in to
  this noble idea and join in rebuilding a badly damaged bridge that have
  hitherto contributed immensely to the huge and monumental successes Ndigbo
  have made in Lagos.” 29 0 1
