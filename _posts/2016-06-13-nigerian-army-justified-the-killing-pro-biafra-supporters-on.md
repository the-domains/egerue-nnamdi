  Nigerian army justified the killing pro-Biafra supporters on May 30 – The army
  claimed that soldiers acted in self-defence when their intervention to restore
  law and order was resisted – Nigerians took to social media to express their
  indignation and discontent Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The Nigerian
  army has recently explained why the soldiers were forced to kill some
  activists who were commemorating Biafra day in some parts of the country.
  Justifying the action, Colonel Hamza Gambo, the deputy director of army public
  relations, 82 Division, Nigerian Army, Enugu, said that soldiers acted in
  self-defence when their intervention to restore law and order was resisted.
  “Instructively, troops of 82 Division Nigerian Army as the lead agency of the
  security agencies had to invoke the extant Rules of Engagement (ROE) to resort
  to self-defence, protection of the strategic Niger Bridge, prevent
  re-enforcement of the pro-Biafran members apparently surging ahead from the
  far side of the strategic Niger Bridge at Onitsha. “In the aftermath of the
  fire fight that ensued, many of our troops sustained varying degree of
  injuries. The injured troops are currently receiving treatment at our medical
  centre. Similarly, five members of MASSOB/IPOB were killed, eight wounded
  while nine were arrested for due legal actions,” he said. READ ALSO: Biafra
