  Erstwhile Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has blamed the
  country’s present economic situation on the zero political will of the
  immediate past government to save for the rainy day. Speaking, yesterday, at
  the George Washington University, Washington D.C. Okonjo-Iweala said the
  Goodluck Jonathan administration differed seriously from the Olusegun Obasanjo
  administration under whose administration the Nigeria government saved $22
  billion, which she said, helped to cushion the dryness that came the way of
  the country at the end of the last decade. Okonjo-Iweala served as finance
  minister under President Obasanjo between 2003 and 2006 and again under
  President Jonathan between 2011 and 2015. The former finance minister and
  World Bank president, who spoke on “inequality, growth and resilience,” with
  Chile as an example of a country with a saving culture, was quoted by The
  Cable, an online news medium, to have said: *Ngozi-Okonjo-Iweala “We tried it
  in Nigeria, we put in an oil price based fiscal rule in 2004 and it worked
  very well. “We saved $22 billion because the political will to do it was
  there. And when the 2008 /2009 crisis came, we were able to draw on those
  savings precisely to issue about a five per cent of GDP fiscal stimulus to the
  economy, and we never had to come to the Bank or the Fund. “This time around
  and this is the key now, you need not only to have the instrument, but you
  also need the political will. In my second time as a finance minister, from
  2011 to 2015, we had the instrument, we had the means, we had done it before,
  but zero political will. “So we were not able to save when we should have.
  That is why you find that Nigeria is now in the situation it is in. Along with
  so many other countries. “That is the question that I ask, what do we need to
  do to these countries to save over a period of long accelerated growth. “We
  need to devise mechanisms not just that are good technically but find a way to
  either embed them in the constitution or find a way to separate them from the
  political manipulation so that these countries can survive over time. “To
  build resilience, African countries need tools, mechanisms and it is doable
  and we need to interrogate ourselves why we have not done it.” The Cable
  further quoted her as saying that manufacturing was also critical to growth in
  Nigeria and the rest of Africa as she was reported to have said that
  manufacturing represented just 11 per cent of GDP in Africa. “I do not believe
  that we can be resilient, except if we can encourage manufacturing even on the
  goods we consume, services, entertainment industry, agriculture. “I think
  these are the kinds of questions that policy makers struggle with on a daily
  basis and that is what we are going to answer to get resilience. “If we don’t
  get these mechanisms, we politicise them, find ways to transform the base of
  the economy and create jobs including in manufacturing, I believe we are going
  to go into this looming deceleration that is being talked about.” 1171 3 3 0
