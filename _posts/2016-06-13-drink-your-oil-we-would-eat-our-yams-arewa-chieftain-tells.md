  Drink your oil, we would eat our yams, Arewa chieftain tells Niger Delta ON
  JUNE 5, 20169:07 PMIN NEWS, POLITICSCOMMENTS Senator Joseph Kennedy N Waku,
  (JKN Waku), the stormy petrel of the Middle Belt was elected senator for the
  Benue North West Constituency of Benue State, on the platform of the Peoples
  Democratic Party, PDP in 1999. Not long after she came into national renown
  following his controversial call for a military coup on the claim that
  President Olusegun Obasanjo was derailing the democracy project. Since then he
  has been an unrepentant critic of President Obasanjo, and a major political
  figure in the North. Waku is not only a chieftain of the ruling All
  Progressives Congress, APC but also of the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF. In
  this interview, he speaks on current national issues. Excerpts: By Joseph
  Erunke What is your reaction to the renewed insurgency by militants in the
  Niger Delta? In the first place, what were the offences committed by these
  people before they were pardoned? Are they not criminals? If I were the
  president, I would jail them. So, are you ruling out dialogue as proposed by
  some people as a way of resolving the problem? What kind of dialogue? Let them
  bring to table what they want. Let them do what they are doing, they will also
  suffer it. Are they also not suffering when they ruin the economy? Are they
  not facing the same problem like you and I? They are talking of
  marginalization today. If you create Biafra today, is Biafra solidly Igbo’s?
  It’s not. When you go there, you would find a southern minority who will tell
  you that they don’t want to be part of it, even among the Igbo. Some Igbo will
  tell you that they don’t want it. If there is definitive kind of
  discrimination against certain segments of the country, that needs to be
  addressed because injustice creates dissatisfaction. If there have been
  injustices against one particular group in this country, let’s address it and
  not by taking the law into their hands. That is criminality. We are also
  affected but we want to take it in a matured approach. You cannot go and begin
  to destroy state apparatus in order to achieve your agitation, it is against
  the law. I am not in a position to talk about which contract was revoked
  because I am not involved in that. If those contracts were illegally awarded
  without going through the due process and the current administration wants to
  follow due process, what is bad about that? Go and do your investigation on
  that contract to see whether the old law that qualifies one for such contracts
  were made. What do you award contracts to militants for? In the first place,
  the name ‘militant’ is criminality. It is only this country that somebody will
  come back and say I am a militant and then ‘you award him contract.’ If they
  claim to be agitators as they are saying, then let them come out with their
  demands and not by holding the state to ransom. Now, how would you want the
  government to handle this situation? My advice is that you can’t take
  government for ransom. If their livelihoods have been damaged considerably by
  the pipelines and they have nowhere to go, let there be adequate compensation
  to them. It is not to take laws into their hands. And by the way, let me be
  honest with you, this is natural resources; nobody owns it and nobody farms it
  but by virtue of the location that you find yourself. If there is ecological
  diversification and you need to do something for your livelihood, then you
  table this issue to the federal government so that there would be amicable
  resolution Giving the adverse effects of their actions, will it not be better
  to seek dialogue? What do they need? Let them come out and tell government
  that ‘this has been our farmland, it has been devastated, we have no land to
  farm anymore’ and then bring a proposal to the federal government. This is how
  it should be done than issuing threats. If I were the president, I would have
  ended that thing by now. How would you have done it? Yes, by closing the whole
  thing down. Before oil came, didn’t this country exist? So, what are you
  talking about? We have been blindfolded and Nigeria became so lazy, a nation
  of cheap money. Before the oil, we had cocoa, we had palm oil, groundnut and
  pyramid, and those were the things that actually helped to develop the oil. At
  a point, we in Benue challenged them that okay,’ let them go and drink their
  oil, we would eat our yams and then see who will survive.’ Read full interview
