  Federal Government Is Not Treating Igbo People Right - Yerima Lucky Vincent 7

  Shettima Yerima, an activist and president of the Arewa Youth Consultative
  Forum (AYCF) in this interview, blows hot about the way the people of the
  South-eastern part of Nigeria have been treated by the government, and why he
  thinks the agitation for Biafra is justified even though it is not the best
  option. The fiery leader of the AYCF also suggests solutions to the crisis.
  Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Alhaji Shettima Yerima, a activist and
  president of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum How did this agitation come
  this far? Well, it’s been a very long journey and for people like us, it is
  not surprising. The agitation for Biafra is not news to us because it has been
  there over time especially since 1966 with what gave birth to the overthrow of
  the Aguiyi Ironsi government after the killing of some top leaders. The
  agitation has been there and that was what led to civil war in 1967 when
  Odimegwu Ojukwu came on board against the state and the reconciliation in the
  1970s. Ever since, there had always been one agitation of the other. But the
  truth of the matter is that nobody is happy about the situation and all of us
  felt that it would not augur and it is not even in the best interest of this
  country for any part to secede now. This is a critical and very challenging
  time. And it is high time we began looking at the issue critically. We are
  only pretending that Nigeria is a nation, it has never been a nation. We just
  pray that it would become a nation. There are very fundamental issues that
  need to be addressed by any government in place and, to do that we must apply
  the principles of equity, justice and fairness to all. The moment we begin to
  say this group of people must be dealt with decisively because of their
  mindset or thinking that they are being marginalised, then there is a problem.
  READ ALSO: Gowon Slams Biafra Agitators The government must be seen to be
  doing justice and discussing issues the way they are. If we continue to
  pretend that things are normal and people are saying they are not normal and
  are agitating, one day it might not be funny. In as much as we pretend that
  things are well, you can see this call for Biafra is getting more popular
  internationally. I pray and I pray the leaders begin to see reasons to look at
  the issues critically. If they feel they are being marginalised and you
  underestimate and threaten them by arresting them and incarcerating them, just
  know that the more you do that, the more they get international and local
  sympathy. At the end of the day, you would be marvelled at what that amounts
  to. It could metamorphose into something beyond your expectation. Detention
  and arrests are not the answers to the issue. Issues must be brought forward
  for discussion. We must disagree to agree so that we can form a nation. We are
  not yet a nation. Under international laws which Nigeria is signatory to, the
  right to see for nationhood is guaranteed. Thus, if people decide that they
  don’t want to be part of your project, there is nothing you can do about it.
  Whatever you do is just to buy time. So why don’t you look at the issues the
  way they are and address them once and for all? This is what I think and it is
  absolutely my opinion. Those sympathetic to President Muhammadu Buhari believe
  that the agitation became intense because the average Igbo man does not like a
  Hausa man being the President. Do you subscribe to this? I do not subscribe to
  that because before Buhari, there were leaders who came from the Nort. Umar
  Yar’Adua was from the North and we could see the support from the East until
  lately when there was this problem of misgivings just before the recent
  elections. The perception of those in the camp of President Buhari is that the
  South-east was against him and that he did not get enough votes from the area
  and so what they bargained for is what they would get. Again, I do not share
  that perception. This is because this is a democracy where everyone has the
  right to decide where he wants to stay and if a government is finally formed
  at the end of the day, that government must be seen to be all-inclusive and
  carry everybody along irrespective of whether you got votes or not. You must
  be seen to be more civilised and behave in very civil ways so that we will all
  feel we are part of this democracy. But where things went wrong and you want
  to pay back, I do not think that is nationalistic. And when the issue of
  appointments came up and some positions that should be shared nationally went
  in one direction as far as we were concerned, some of us raised alarm we did
  not raise alarm because we don’t enjoy Buhari, but because we know he is human
  and those who work with him are also human. So where something is going wrong,
  there is no problem in calling the person to correct it. I do not think it is
  in the best interest of Nigerians to play politics with things like this
  because the only reason Buhari is elected is because people gave him mandate
  to be President of Nigeria and so issues of a section of the country not
  giving him their votes should not arise. The perception became more glaring
  and visible because certain things happened in recent times, especially just
  before the election, after the election and in appointments. It is not because
  they hate Buhari but certain things have gone wrong and it is better to
  address them. As long as they remain part of the country, what belongs to them
  must be given. But where we believe that some parts of the country should be
  treated as second-class citizens, then we are not doing justice to the nation
  or that we want the country to survive. This is just the truth of it. There is
  also this argument that the South-east is not ripe enough to call for
  secession because there is not particular leader to take them out of the
  woods. An analyst recently cited the case of South Sudan. What do you think?
  That they are not mature enough, how is that our problem, the problem of
  anybody or a section of the country? By law, how is that a problem? It is
  either you decide to carry them along or if you feel they are a burden to you,
  then allow them to go. When a child decides that it is time to come out of her
  mummy’s womb, you can’t stop the child. Oftentimes, we make the mistake of
  comparing Nigeria with other countries forgetting that we do not share the
  same culture. We are people from different backgrounds, religions and
  environments. So I do not share that sentiment. There are also countries that
  broke and the seceding countries are living on their own. Have you ever seen
  where a country breaks up and the parts come back together because it was a
  mistake? It has never happened. So who is afraid in the case of Nigeria? If we
  cannot do justice to all, then let everyone go peacefully. For me, I do not
  think the entire North should be held responsible for not allowing the East to
  go. For me, if they choose to go, so be it. The day we fee tired of this
  project called Nigeria, we too in the North would say we are going. Let nobody
  hold anybody to ransom. I only just think going our separate ways is not the
  best answer, but let’s also begin to decide for them as if we should tell what
  they want or not. If we cannot bring equity and justice to this table and
  discuss it, then what is the essence of this pretence? We don’t have to
  pretend; the country is sick and we need a man who truly believes in the
  nation to govern it rather than heating it up. And this is where I differ
  because with the problem at hand like insurgency in the northern part of the
  country, there should not be any reason to create another monster in another
  part of the country. Leaders must be seen to be low-headed at this time. Let
  us not be fooled, this is the best time for leaders to put their heads
  together and see how things would be solved and appreciate the fact that we
  come from different backgrounds. Let us not abuse this opportunity. If found
  wanting, let us address the problem and stop behaving like there is no
  problem. The moment you begin to say some people should be sidelined, then you
  are not bargaining for peace. READ ALSO: Radio Biafra Director Granted Bail In
  resolving this problem now, do you suggest that the report of the last
  National Conference should be looked into? The report of the National
  Conference cannot be a reason to start looking at a new Nigeria because even
  some of us have issues with the Confab and its composition and how it went.
  This government must be open because if we cannot sit down and discuss it,
  then there is a problem. This government must be create an atmosphere and
  engage everyone. I believe a Sovereign National Conference is the answer to
  this whole thing and there must be no no-go area. People must be allowed to
  discuss issues. Often, when the issues of national discourse emerge, these
  mischief makers, these crooks who are 80 percent criminally-minded people at
  the National Assembly would tell you that they are the ones to discuss them.
  You cannot be the manager of Nigeria because they voted for you. You cannot
  just wake up one morning and declare that the sovereignty of the people is now
  your own. Allow the rightful owners decide how they want to live together and
  move forward. The constitution we have today is fraud. We challenge the
  legality of the preamble of the constitution. You cannot be move a country
  forward where there is problem. The country is sick! We can only buy time, but
  the day it would escalate, everyone would start running helter-skelter. And I
  am afraid that the prediction of America that Nigeria would break would not
  come to pass. Unfortunately, the government of the day believes so much in
  America. In fact, they even consult America before introducing some local
  policies to us. You can see how bad it is that after 55 years, Nigeria has not
  grown enough to decide how we want to govern ourselves. Must we consult
  America? Why can’t we do our thing our own way? Who even tells you America is
  in support of Nigerians uniting together? History has shown that so many wars
  and insurgency around the world have the imprint of America. Can’t we learn
  from history? Do we want to go into another civil war? I can tell you that if
  Nigeria goes into another civil war now, we will not survive it.
