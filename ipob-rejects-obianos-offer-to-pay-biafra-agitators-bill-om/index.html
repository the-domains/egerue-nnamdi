<p>IPOB rejects Obiano's offer to pay Biafra agitator's bill Omotayo Yusuf 3 days ago 58999 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Send email – IPOB has accused Governor Obiano of trying to get cheap popularity – The separatist group said it does not want the governor’s offer – An APC chieftain in Enugu also blamed the governor The Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) has rejected the offer of Governor Wille Obiano of Anambra state to pay the hospital bills of Biafra agitators injured during their 49 years anniversary. Vanguard reports that the governor made the pledge at Nkpor town hall when he came to sympathize with the people of Nkpor. READ ALSO: MASSOB issues warning to Governor Obiano During the celebration of the declaration of Biafra on Monday, June 30, there was a clash between pro-Biafra agitators and the army which led to the death of some members of the separatist group while several others were injured. IPOB through its media and publicity officer Mr Emma Powerful dismissed the governor’s offer to offset the hospital bills of the wounded Biafra and non Biafra agitators and described the gesture as medicine after death and an attempt to win cheap popularity. “The governor was insulting the families of the dead Biafrans and those that their own are still nursing gunshot wounds in different hospitals and for the purpose of clarity, no gunshot wound victim is still in Anambra State, they have all been taken out of Anambra because the soldiers were combing all the hospitals in the state for them.” READ ALSO: MASSOB, BIM appeal to UN to divide Nigeria Chief Zeribe Ezeanuna who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in the state faulted the governor for the clash. He demanded an apology from him and claimed that if he had not sanctioned the military engagement, it would not have been carried out. Meanwhile, IPOB has labelled Igbo elders who visited President Muhammadu Buhari as traitors. The elders visited the president in the wake of the clash that occurred between protesters and Biafra agitators. In a press statement signed by its coordinator, Clifford Iroanya, the group said it was surprised at the likes of those who rushed to Buhari and congratulated him for reportedly killing Biafrans on the fateful day and not to condemn his murderous act or to discuss the process of restoration of Biafra.</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://www.naij.com/854563-biafra-ipob-reacts-governor-obianos-offer-pay-bills-biafra-agitators.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">naij.com/854563-biafra-ipob-reacts-governor-obianos-offer-pay-bills-biafra-agitators.html</a></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

Vanguard reports that the governor made the pledge at Nkpor town hall when he came to sympathize with the people of Nkpor. READ ALSO: MASSOB issues warning to Governor Obiano During the celebration of the declaration of Biafra on Monday, June 30, there was a clash between pro-Biafra agitators and the army which led to the death of some members of the separatist group while several others were injured. IPOB through its media and publicity officer Mr Emma Powerful dismissed the governor’s offer to offset the hospital bills of the wounded Biafra and non Biafra agitators and described the gesture as medicine after death and an attempt to win cheap popularity. “The governor was insulting the families of the dead Biafrans and those that their own are still nursing gunshot wounds in different hospitals and for the purpose of clarity, no gunshot wound victim is still in Anambra State, they have all been taken out of Anambra because the soldiers were combing all the hospitals in the state for them.” READ ALSO: MASSOB, BIM appeal to UN to divide Nigeria Chief Zeribe Ezeanuna who is a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in the state faulted the governor for the clash. He demanded an apology from him and claimed that if he had not sanctioned the military engagement, it would not have been carried out. Meanwhile, IPOB has labelled Igbo elders who visited President Muhammadu Buhari as traitors. The elders visited the president in the wake of the clash that occurred between protesters and Biafra agitators. In a press statement signed by its coordinator, Clifford Iroanya, the group said it was surprised at the likes of those who rushed to Buhari and congratulated him for reportedly killing Biafrans on the fateful day and not to condemn his murderous act or to discuss the process of restoration of Biafra.","_html":"<p>IPOB rejects Obiano's offer to pay Biafra agitator's bill Omotayo Yusuf 3 days ago 58999 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Send email – IPOB has accused Governor Obiano of trying to get cheap popularity – The separatist group said it does not want the governor’s offer – An APC chieftain in Enugu also blamed the governor The Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) has rejected the offer of Governor Wille Obiano of Anambra state to pay the hospital bills of Biafra agitators injured during their 49 years anniversary.
