<p>Nigerian army justified the killing pro-Biafra supporters on May 30 – The army claimed that soldiers acted in self-defence when their intervention to restore law and order was resisted – Nigerians took to social media to express their indignation and discontent Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The Nigerian army has recently explained why the soldiers were forced to kill some activists who were commemorating Biafra day in some parts of the country. Justifying the action, Colonel Hamza Gambo, the deputy director of army public relations, 82 Division, Nigerian Army, Enugu, said that soldiers acted in self-defence when their intervention to restore law and order was resisted. “Instructively, troops of 82 Division Nigerian Army as the lead agency of the security agencies had to invoke the extant Rules of Engagement (ROE) to resort to self-defence, protection of the strategic Niger Bridge, prevent re-enforcement of the pro-Biafran members apparently surging ahead from the far side of the strategic Niger Bridge at Onitsha. “In the aftermath of the fire fight that ensued, many of our troops sustained varying degree of injuries. The injured troops are currently receiving treatment at our medical centre. Similarly, five members of MASSOB/IPOB were killed, eight wounded while nine were arrested for due legal actions,” he said.

army justified the killing pro-Biafra supporters on May 30 – The army claimed that soldiers acted in self-defence when their intervention to restore law and order was resisted – Nigerians took to

commemorating Biafra day in some parts of the country. Justifying the action, Colonel Hamza Gambo, the deputy director of army public relations, 82 Division, Nigerian Army, Enugu, said that soldiers acted in self-defence when their intervention to restore law and order was resisted. “Instructively, troops of 82 Division Nigerian Army as the lead agency of the security agencies had to invoke the extant Rules of Engagement (ROE) to resort to self-defence, protection of the strategic Niger Bridge, prevent re-enforcement of the pro-Biafran members apparently surging ahead from the far side of the strategic Niger Bridge at Onitsha. “In the aftermath of the fire fight that ensued, many of our troops sustained varying degree of injuries.
